It's hard to find the marketing expenses of GitHub. However, we can assume **marketing-to-revenue (M/R) ratio**:
- Early Stage (High Growth): 100% (2007 - 2009)
- Growth Stage: 50% (2010 - 2014)
- Mature Stage: 30% (2016 - 2024)

### Has the acquisition of GitHub by Microsoft already paid off?

#### Accounting GitHub's profit

Microsoft acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion in Microsoft stock in 2018.
Based on my [GitHub Financial Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18hRotgpXVpI85f9vgPm4XcE-6EjhPO5NxC-C3PvHctY/edit?usp=sharing)
by the end of 2024 (6 years after the acquisition), GitHub will have its profit of **$2.2 billion since 2018**. It's still **less than the acquisition price**, but it's a good sign that GitHub is on the right track.

#### Accounting GitHub's growth

Looks like GitHub is investing in grows. The company has more and more personnel year by year.

#### Accounting Microsoft's stock price growth

Microsoft's stock price growth since 2018 which is **360%** $7.5 billion in 2018 is now **$27 billion**.

#### Conclusion

**It has not paid off yet**. Especially, if we consider Microsoft's stock price growth. However, GitHub is on the right track.
